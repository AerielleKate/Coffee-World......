			<h1>WELCOME TRAVELER!</h1>
				<p>Hi there! Welcome to the Coffee World, Travel While Staying website. Our shop provides you different kinds, styles and types of coffees that are originated from different countries
				around the world like in America and Italy. Aside from tasting them, you can also learn many facts from their origins because we are glad to inform you that
				we also provide fact sheets about a certain coffee that you have ordered that will tell you about its origin and where it came from. Our shop is not only focusing on the outcomes of each coffee but also focuses on the
				safety and hygiene of the place, utensils and others. Our shop is only starting, but has already many positive feedbacks. We will assure you a proper and well-mannered
				service coming from our employees especially to you. Hope we'll see you there! Let's travel while staying.</p>
