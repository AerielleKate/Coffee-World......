			<h1> THE COFFEE LOVER </h1>
			<p>	Coffee World was opened to the public on May 10, 2033. The ribbon cutting was spearheaded by Ms. Aerielle Aprecio, the owner of the said coffee shop. Aerielle loves to drink
			coffee eversince she was in high school. She loves iced coffee the most, especially iced mocha. Because of her love of coffee, she dreamt about studying and discovering the origins 
			of different coffees around the world. Now that she is already educated about the histories of the different flavors of coffee, she wanted to share it to the public especially to 
			the people who are also coffee enthusiasts like her. </p>

			<h1> COFFEE WORLD IS BORN </h1>
			<p> These dreams and love of her pursued her to make a coffee shop that is all based from her own ideas. It all started with scratch. She had a hard time finding some investors and partnerships from
			other businessmen and women, plus she had also a hard time finding a perfect place for her shop. She seeked some help from other professional and successful business persons. When the shop was already finished,
			she thought that she will have a hard time intrducing it from other but to her contentment, the people already loved it. There are also many coffee shops around the city that are first to be built than her, so 
			she is so shocked when it became a hit on its first few weeks. The Coffee World is now considered as successful, and has already branches in Baguio City, Vigan City, and soon in Manila. If you want to try this
			new experience for you, visit us now!</p>
